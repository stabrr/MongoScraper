MongoDB and Cheerio Scrapper

Synopsis

This project is a homework assignment working with MongoDB and Cheerio to scrap the NYtimes and list article and save them.  It should also be able to delete them but was not able to output the save articles so I could add the delete button.  Also supposed to add notes but did not get there.


Motivation

This is a homework assginment for Northwestern University Coding boot camp to understand how MongoDB and Cheerio works.  I have a pretty good understand of both but still struggle with incorporating the front with the back end.  I can do front end work and backend work but really struggle to send the backend data back to the front.


Refer to package.json for packages used


Click to save and buttons on top will scrape for more articles and click saved articles for the saved articles.
